So you've passed your code challenge assessment and have an interview scheduled to go over it. Here's how you might spend your time before the interview prepping for it:

1. Ask your TL for your submission in PDF form.
2. For each problem:
   1. Review the prompt to re-familiarize yourself with the problem.
   2. Re-familiarize yourself with your own implementation.
   3. Close / minimize the window with your implementation.
   4. Talk through what your code is doing at a high level, without consulting your code; find a non-programmer friend and talk them through the problem and how you solved it at a conceptual level until they understand your methodology. The goal here is to practice articulating through the _strategy_ behind your code in order to convince someone else that you _understand_ the underlying problem that your implementation is addressing. **_If you're just repeating your code back line by line, you're doing it wrong!_**
   5. If there are issues with your code, try to figure out what those issues are; be prepared to talk about them during your interview and have an answer prepared for the following:
      - _What caused this issue?_
      - _How can we address it / fix it?_
   6. Figure out the time and space complexities for your implementation, and be able to talk about _why_ you think your solution exhibits those complexities.
      - Ask yourself: what's the _best_ possible time / space complexity for this problem?
      - How does my implementation compare to ideal time / space complexity?
      - What are some ways in which we could tweak / change my implementation to improve on its time / space complexity (assuming your implementation doesn't hit the ideal)?
3. **If you skipped one of the problems on the assessment and weren't able to get around to answering it in the remaining time, you will still be asked about how you would solve the problem during the interview:**
   1. Take some time before your interview to work through the problem and come up with a plan for how you would solve it.
   2. During the interview, you will be asked to explain how you would solve the problem; **note that during the interview the only thing you will allowed to reference your submitted code. This means that if you are asked a problem you did not write any code for, you will need to be able to explain your plan for a problem that you didn't actually implement.** Practice running through and explaining this plan to a friend or inanimate object before going into your interview.
   3. You will also be asked to give an estimate of the time complexity for your strategy. Be sure you're able to answer this question, along with _why_ your strategy exhibits the runtime you think it does.

Being able to talk about all of the above points well will almost certainly ensure that you pass your interview with flying colors. So it definitely behooves you to practice talking about these points before your actual interview.
