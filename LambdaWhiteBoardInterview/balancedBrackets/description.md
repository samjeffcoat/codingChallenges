QUESTION DESCRIPTION
Write a function that takes a string as input. The string can contain four types of brackets: "[]", "()", "{}", and "||". Your function should return a boolean indicating whether or not the string is balanced. Note that pipes brackets use the same character to indicate both opening and closing.
A string is considered balanced if it has as many opening brackets of a given type as it has closing brackets of that same type. No bracket can be left unmatched if the string is to be considered balanced. A closing bracket also cannot match a corresponding opening bracket that comes after it. Brackets also cannot overlap each other, i.e., "[(])".
Examples:
"[(])" should return false
"foo(bar)baz" should return true
"{{||[]||}}" should return true
"I am happy to take your donation; any amount will be greatly appreciated." should return true
"I (wa)n{t to buy a on}esie[...] b(u{[t] kno}w it) wonâ€™t suit me." should return true
"This is t(he la[st random sentence I will be writing |and| I am going to stop mid-sent]" should return false
Note that HackerRank's expected output from your code will be a 0 indicating false or a 1
indicating true . You may opt to return 1 and 0 as your truthy and falsey values, or actual
booleans true and false ; either option will work. HackerRank's platform will coerce a true value to 1 and a false value to 0 behind the scenes.
